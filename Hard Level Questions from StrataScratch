https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10303-top-percentile-fraud?code_type=1

Descritpion:ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased 
significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify
propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims
identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. 
Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

Using SQL:

select 
    policy_num,
    state,
    claim_cost,
    fraud_score,rnk from 
            (select 
                t.*,
                percent_rank() over (partition by state order by fraud_score desc ) as rnk
            from 
                fraud_score t) t

where rnk <= 0.05

Descritpion:Find stores that were opened in the second half of 2021 with more than 20% of their reviews being negative.

Using SQL:

select 
    name,
    sum(case when score < 5 then 1 else 0 end)/sum(case when score >= 5 then 1 else 0 end)
from 
    instacart_stores s
left join 
    instacart_reviews r on r.store_id = s.id
where 
    opening_date >= '2021-07-01'
group by 
    name
having 
 sum(case when score < 5 then 1 else 0 end)/count(*)::float * 100 > 20

Descritpion:Find the top 5 states with the most 5 star businesses. 
Output the state name along with the number of 5-star businesses and order records by the number of 5-star businesses in descending order.

If two states have the same result, sort them in alphabetical order.

Using SQL:

with businesses_by_state as (select 
    t.state,
    count(*) as number_of_businesses,
    rank() over (order by count(*) desc) as rnk
from 
    yelp_business t
where 
    t.stars = 5
group by 
    t.state)

select 
    * 
from 
    businesses_by_state
where 
    rnk <=5
order by 
    state asc,
    number_of_businesses desc

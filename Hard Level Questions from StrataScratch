https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10303-top-percentile-fraud?code_type=1

Descritpion:ABC Corp is a mid-sized insurer in the US and in the recent past their fraudulent claims have increased 
significantly for their personal auto insurance portfolio. They have developed a ML based predictive model to identify
propensity of fraudulent claims. Now, they assign highly experienced claim adjusters for top 5 percentile of claims
identified by the model.
Your objective is to identify the top 5 percentile of claims from each state. 
Your output should be policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

Using SQL:

select 
    policy_num,
    state,
    claim_cost,
    fraud_score,rnk from 
            (select 
                t.*,
                percent_rank() over (partition by state order by fraud_score desc ) as rnk
            from 
                fraud_score t) t

where rnk <= 0.05
